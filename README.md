"Real Words" are actual words that will be used for the daily Wordle.
"Valid Words" are 5-letter strings that the game will accept as valid guesses.

There are 2,309 actual words.
There are 10,665 total strings listed as valid guesses.
These lists are mutually exclusive, so there are actually 12,974 total valid guesses for this game.
